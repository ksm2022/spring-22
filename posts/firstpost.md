Kelly Maher has spent most of her adult years creating digital content for brands such as Volkswagen, Toyota, State Farm, Proctor & Gamble, Publix, and Bank of America. She started her career on the east coast as a Creative Director for Pace Communications, but after a few mild winters realized her heart belonged in the snowy Midwest. She began her Marketing and Design Consulting business in 2002, where she worked with Accenture and Meredith Corporation for many years and is currently Head of Content for a global FinTech start-up. Kelly is deeply passionate about customer engagement and creating beautiful things.
